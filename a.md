In heart of Texas, where the wild things play,
A campus thrives, in a most wonderful way.
The University of Texas, a name so bold,
A symbol of pride, for all to behold.

From the Tower high, to the lake's calm shore,
The Forty Acres bloom, with life galore.
Students stroll and laugh, beneath the pecan trees,
Their Longhorn spirit, as vibrant as the breeze.

In McCombs Hall, the business minds unite,
In Engineering, the innovators take flight.
In Liberal Arts, the thinkers roam and explore,
Each college a haven, for hearts that yearn more.

The Darrell K Royal Memorial Stadium's mighty roar,
Echoes through the streets, on game day galore.
Bevo's proud steed, with horn and red coat shine,
A symbol of tradition, forever divine.

From the Hill to the Drag, the campus pulse beats strong,
A melting pot of cultures, where hearts belong.
In UT Austin's halls, a story unfolds each year,
Of dreams pursued, of knowledge shared, and hope held dear.
