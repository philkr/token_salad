Under Texas skies, where the sun dips low,
The Longhorn's spirit roams, with a heart that glows.
In West Campus' streets, where students love to roam,
A vibrant tapestry weaves, of home and heart of home.

From the Tower's stones, to the lake's serene face,
The Forty Acres whisper secrets, in a gentle, peaceful space.
The smell of Texas barbecue, wafts through the air,
As Longhorns gather, with friends who show they care.

In Gregory Gym's halls, where athletes train and strive,
Their sweat and dedication, forge a spirit that thrives.
The McDavid Center shines, like a beacon in the night,
A hub for innovation, where minds take flight.

Bevo's proud tradition, of tailgating delight,
Echoes through the decades, with a joyous, loud sight.
In Darrell K Royal Stadium's roar, the fans' spirits soar,
As the Longhorns charge ahead, on game day galore.

Through laughter and tears, through triumphs and defeats,
The UT Austin family bonds, in an unbreakable treat.
In every corner of campus, a story unfolds each year,
Of dreams pursued, of hearts that beat, and hope that's clear.
